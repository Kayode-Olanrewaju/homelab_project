## Troubleshooting: IP Change and Static Assignment
During initial setup, we ran into an issue where the Arch Linux IP address changed. This broke SSH access from the Windows system because the Windows `hosts` file still pointed to the old IP. The solution was to assign static IPs to both machines at the router (DHCP reservation). This ensured both systems maintained consistent IP addresses across reboots.

## sysctl: Kernel Parameter Hardening
`sysctl` allows runtime modification of Linux kernel parameters and persistent configuration via `/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf`. We installed and configured security-focused sysctl settings to:
- Harden the network stack against spoofing and scans.
- Limit information leakage.
- Prepare for Kubernetes networking requirements.

### Steps:
1. Verify `procps-ng` installed:
```bash
pacman -Qi procps-ng
```
2. Create `/etc/sysctl.d/99-security.conf` with security and K3s-required settings:
```ini
# Ignore ICMP broadcast requests
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1
# Ignore bogus ICMP errors
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1
# Reverse path filtering (anti-spoof)
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
# Disable source routing
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
# Disable ICMP redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
# Log suspicious packets
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians = 1
# SYN flood protection
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
# K3s prerequisites
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 131072
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288
fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 1024
```
3. Apply settings:
```bash
sudo sysctl --system
```
4. Load required modules for K3s networking:
```bash
sudo modprobe br_netfilter overlay
```
Persist modules:
```bash
echo -e "br_netfilter\noverlay" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
```

## UFW: Firewall Configuration
`ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) manages `iptables` rules in a user-friendly way. Our goals:
- Default deny all incoming traffic.
- Allow only ICMP (ping) and SSH from the Windows laptopâ€™s IP.
- Block all other inbound traffic.

### Steps:
1. Set default policy:
```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```
2. Remove unsafe broad rules:
```bash
sudo ufw delete allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw delete allow from 10.0.0.0/24
sudo ufw delete allow 22
```
3. Allow SSH only from Windows:
```bash
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.142 to any port 22 proto tcp
```
4. Allow ICMP only from Windows by editing `/etc/ufw/before.rules` before the `# End required lines` marker:
```
-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -s 10.0.0.142 -j ACCEPT
```
Reload UFW:
```bash
sudo ufw reload
```
5. Verify rules:
```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

With this setup, only your Windows machine can ping or SSH into Arch, and all other inbound traffic is blocked. This is a strong security baseline for moving into Kubernetes (K3s) installation.
